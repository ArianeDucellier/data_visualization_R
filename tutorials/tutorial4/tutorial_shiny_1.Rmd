# Tutorial Shiny part 1

We are going to start by creating a very simple dashboard within an RMarkdown document. You just need to choose the option Shiny / Shiny Document when creating a new RMarkdown document. Then all the code for the user interface and the creation of the dashboard content can be specified in a code chunk in the RMarkdown file. Finally, you can click Run Document to see the dashboard.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Load the necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)

# Create a panel for the user to enter some input
inputPanel(
  # Create a check box
  checkboxInput("linear", label = "Add trend line?", value = FALSE) 
) 

# Function to draw a plot 
renderPlot({ 

  # Create the plot
  thePlot = gapminder %>%
    filter(year > 1960) %>%
    group_by(continent, year) %>%
    summarise(meanLife = mean(lifeExp)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = year, y = meanLife, group = continent, colour = continent)) +
    geom_line()

  # Add the trend if the box has been checked by the user  
  if(input$linear){ 
    thePlot = thePlot + geom_smooth(method = "lm") 
  } 

  # Print the plot  
  print(thePlot)
})

```
