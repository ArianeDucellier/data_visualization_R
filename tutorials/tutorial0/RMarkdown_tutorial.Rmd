# Tutorial R Markdown

By default, these lines are included when you create a new R Markdown document. "echo=TRUE" means that your code will be included by default in the final knitted document. As this specific chunk uses the option "include=FALSE", it will be evaluated, but neither the code nor its output will be displayed.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Below are some examples of R chunks that are included in your new R Markdown document. Note the difference between the first chunk that uses the default "echo=TRUE" to print both the code and the output, and the second chunk that uses the option "echo=FALSE" to hide the code but show the output (here the plot).

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Quick Markdown tutorial

Let us now look at the most used syntax to write text in R Markdown format.

_Italic text_

**Bold text**

# Header one

## Header two

### Header three

> "A quote"

* List item 1
* List item 2

1. Ordered list item 1
2. Ordered list item 2

Line 1 followed by at least two spaces to break the line  
Line 2

$x = \frac{y}{z}$

We can also save the result of some computation and include it in the text later.

```{r compute}
result <- 2 + 4
```

Here is the result: `r result`.

It is also possible to include tables displaying the content of a dataframe.

```{r ktable, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(mtcars[1:5], caption="A knitr table")
```
