```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Load R packages

```{r}
library(igraph)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Load the data

Biggest US airports

```{r airports}
airports <- c("ATL", "DFW", "DEN", "ORD", "LAX", "JFK", "LAS", "MCO", "MIA",
              "CLT", "SEA", "PHX", "EWR", "SFO", "IAH", "BOS", "FLL", "MSP",
              "LGA", "DTW")
```

Flights data set

```{r flights}
flights <- read_csv("../data/routes.csv")
flights <- flights %>%
  filter(`source airport` %in% airports, `destination apirport` %in% airports) %>%
  group_by(`source airport`, `destination apirport`) %>% summarise(count=n())
```

Create a network using the airports and the number of flights from and to each airport as edges and vertices.

Make a plot of the network.
