```

In this lab, we are going to visualize two highly correlated variables from the loan data set.

## Libraries

Load the necessary libraries.

```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data

Load the data.

```{r data}
df <- read.csv("../data/LoanStats.csv")
df <- subset(df, grade=="A")
```

## Plot

Complete the cell with the code to make the plot. We need to use highly correlated variables, try:
- total_rec_prncp and total_pymnt_int
- funded_amnt, total_pymnt_inv

```{r plot}
```
