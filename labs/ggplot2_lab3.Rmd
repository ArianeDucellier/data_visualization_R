In this lab, we are going to improve some of the plots from Lab 2 by adding aesthetics to the plot.

## Libraries

Load the necessary libraries.

```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data

Load the data.

```{r data}
df_edu <- read_csv("../data/xAPI-Edu-Data.csv")
```

## Plot 1

```{r plot1}
ggplot(df_edu, aes(x=Topic)) + geom_bar()
```

## Plot 2

Complete the cell with the code to improve the plot. You may add labels and title, change the size of the labels, change the number of bins...

```{r plot2}
ggplot(df_edu, aes(x=VisitedResources)) + geom_histogram()
