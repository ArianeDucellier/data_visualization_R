In this lab, we are going to visualize the relationship between loan amounts and home ownership for different credit grades (column name = grade).

## Libraries

Load the necessary libraries.

```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data

Load the data.

```{r data}
df <- read_csv("../../data/LoanStats.csv")
dfn <- df[, c("home_ownership", "loan_amnt", "grade")]
dfn <- na.omit(dfn)
dfn <- subset(dfn, !dfn$home_ownership %in% c("NONE"))
```

## Plot

Complete the cell with the code to make the plot.

```{r plot}
```
