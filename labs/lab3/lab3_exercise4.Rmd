# Lab 3: Ggplot2 - Exercise 4

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = TRUE)
```

In this lab, we are going to visualize two highly correlated variables from the loan data set. Think scatter plot and linear regression.

## Libraries

Load the necessary libraries.

```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data

Load the data.

```{r data}
df <- read.csv("../../data/LoanStats.csv")
df <- subset(df, grade=="A")
```

## Plot

Complete the cell with the code to make the plot. We need to use highly correlated variables, try:
- total_rec_prncp and total_pymnt_int
- funded_amnt, total_pymnt_inv

```{r plot}
```
