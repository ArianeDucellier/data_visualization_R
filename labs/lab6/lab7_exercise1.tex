\textbf{\Large{Shiny - Lab 5}}
\end{center}

\vspace{2em}

In this lab, we will reproduce the visualization done in lab 3 with a flex dashboard. We will visualize the national sites dataset (\verb|nationalSites.Rdata|). Create a flex dashboard document and save it into a folder with the data file.

\vspace{1em}

Write code to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Let the user choose between plotting sites that contain the string "National Park", "National Historic Site", or "National Monument".
	\item See the corresponding number of sites in one tab.
	\item See a map of the sites in another tab. Include the possibility of clicking on a site to see its name.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{1em}

You may use the \verb|str_detect| function from the \verb|tidyverse| package to filter the national sites and the \verb|popup| argument from the \verb|addCircleMarkers| function to be able to click on a site and see its name.
